        Iâ€™m a research student in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) group at the University of Ghana, working at the intersection of speech technology, accessibility, and local language AI. My research focuses on developing speech-to-speech systems to support Akan speakers with speech impairmentsâ€”enabling more natural, intelligible, and inclusive communication. My work integrates machine learning, deep learning, and advanced speech processing to address real-world challenges in low-resource linguistic settings. I document key insights, tools, and findings through my blog to support other researchers and developers working in similar domains. I apply quantitative research methods to investigate how language technologies can advance economic and social inclusion, particularly across underrepresented communities. If you're exploring similar questions or building related tools, Iâ€™d love to connect and collaborate.
        Letâ€™s build something meaningful togetherâ€”feel free to reach out!
