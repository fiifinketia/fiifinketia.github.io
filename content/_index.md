      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''

        I’m a research student with the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) group at the University of Ghana, where I focus on building speech technologies for African languages—especially Akan. My current work involves developing Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for a maternal health chatbot.

        I integrate neural architectures like VITS and YourTTS, with emphasis on prosody modeling, speaker adaptation, and low-resource data strategies. I also build tools for audio segmentation, transcription, and evaluation to accelerate dataset creation and model benchmarking across diverse speakers and conditions.

        Beyond technical development, I explore how inclusive NLP systems can enhance access to healthcare, education, and civic participation in underrepresented communities. If you're working on related problems or care about making African languages more present in digital spaces, I’d love to connect.
