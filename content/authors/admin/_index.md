## About Me

Ghanaian AI researcher and software engineer with over five years of experience building scalable systems across eCommerce, blockchain, and AI research enablement. I have contributed to projects such as UGSpeech Data, Kasa Tutor, and TTS models focused on African languages, working at institutions like WiV Technologies, Chatdaddy, Data Intelligence and Swarm Analytics Lab, and the HCI Lab at the University of Ghana Department of Computer Science. Currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science at the University of Ghana, I specialize in Natural Language Processing, Human-Computer Interaction, and Text-to-Speech systems for low-resource and tonal languages. I am deeply involved in academic research, speech dataset development, and community-centered AI projects. My goal is building inclusive, explainable, and culturally aware AI systems that reflect the linguistic diversity of the African continentâ€”especially in health, education, and public service applications.
