The DCS-HCI NLP Suite is an integrated platform designed to support Natural Language Processing tools for local African languages, with a current focus on Akan. The system provides modular capabilities including advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS), intelligent spell checking, and TTS model evaluation workflows. It features a FastAPI backend for scalable API delivery, model orchestration, and diagnostics, and a Vue.js frontend for interactive use. 

Key features include multi-speaker TTS with adjustable speech rate, dynamic model loading, and MOS-based evaluation with reference audio comparison. The spell-checking module offers word- and sentence-level correction using multiple models, tightly integrated with the TTS pipeline for seamless synthesis. All outputs are versioned and stored for traceable evaluation and reproducibility.
